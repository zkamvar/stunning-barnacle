# Landscape View of the New Lesson Template

This repository contains a Markdown document (initially written in CodiMD) that lays the specifications for the new version of The Carpentries Lesson Template.
It also contains progress updates for the lesson template in terms of a sort of "Lab Meeting" report taken from Dr. Kirsty J Whittaker's [Weekly Meeting Template](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding/blob/8cf5932dbcee01bd2ca9a5be3fd9a2869a6f8d1f/Setting-up-your-weekly-meetings.md).
