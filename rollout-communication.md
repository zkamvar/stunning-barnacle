# Recruitment for alpha phase

Dear {{maintainer}},

Thank you for agreeing to participate in the alpha test of the NEW Carpentries 
Lesson Template. We have redesigned the lesson template from the ground up to 
be organized in a way that should make sense from the perspective of lesson 
design. The new version of the template uses R and pandoc to generate the
site with the help of GitHub Actions for deployment. 

Your participation in these early stages of development are *crucial* for ensuring 
that the foundation of the template is durable. 

* invest some time to read/improve early documentation
* provide feedback on their experiences and the painpoints they encounter
* be willing to test something that might not work/break
